# Jumpy
This is an infinite vertical platformer game where you control a ninja frog and try to get as high a score as you can.
All the source code is in the files area and the releases section and you can download it and run it. If you would rather prefer an executable,
then there is an executable in the releases section. As of now, there is only an executable for Windows.
The instructions for using the executable are shown in the description for the release. If you are on another OS which cannot run windows executables, then use the source code.
If you are using the source code, then download all the files (The Assets folder, and the three python files), and put them all in the same folder.
Then, run the python file called "jumpy.py" and let the game load. Once it loads, you can play! While you are playing, you may notice some new files being generated in the folder by the game.
Do not delete these files or else the game might not run as expected. These generated files include JSON files, cache files, and a few others.


Happy Jumping!!!
